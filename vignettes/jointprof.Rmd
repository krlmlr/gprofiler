The three rules of software optimization are:

1. Don't.
2. Don't do it yet.
3. Profile before optimizing.

A profiler is a tool that identifies which parts of your code take the most time. One way to do this is to run the code and halt execution every so often (by default 50 times per second), and record the [call stack](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/sys.parent) on each occurrence. The combined samples will likely show in which part of your code the most time is spent.

In R, a sampling profiler is available via [`Rprof()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.4.3/topics/Rprof), but it provides detailed measurements only for R code. This vignette shows how to include detailed information on native code run times in the profile.

## Prerequisite: Code to profile

For this vignette, we'll be profiling R and C++ implementations of functions that computes the Fibonacci sequence using [dynamic programming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_programming#In_computer_programming):

```{r fib-r}
fib_r <- function(x) {
  if (x <= 2) return(rep(1, x))
  fib <- fib_r(x - 1)
  c(fib, fib[x - 1] + fib[x - 2])
}
```

```{Rcpp}
#include <Rcpp.h>

// [[Rcpp::export]]
Rcpp::NumericVector fib_cpp(int x) {
  if (x <= 1) return Rcpp::NumericVector::create(1);
  if (x <= 2) return Rcpp::NumericVector::create(1, 1);
  Rcpp::NumericVector fib = fib_cpp(x - 1);

  // Zero-based indexing!
  fib.push_back(fib[x - 1 - 1] + fib[x - 2 - 1]);

  return fib;
}
```

(A few tweaks are necessary to allow profiling the *Rcpp*-compiled function when run from the vignette. See the source for details.)

```{r patch-fib-r, include = FALSE}
# Still necessary
compiler::enableJIT(0)
```

The implementations are supposed to behave identically.

```{r eval-fib}
fib_r(10)
fib_cpp(10)
```

Our test function `test()` calls both functions and compares their output in a loop:

```{r test-fun}
test <- function(i) {
  for (i in seq_len(i)) {
    stopifnot(identical(fib_r(i), fib_cpp(i)))
  }
}
```

## A minimal example

`Rprof()` creates a text file that contains the stack trace for each interruption. The [`summaryRprof()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/utils/versions/3.4.3/topics/summaryRprof) function converts this to a data frame with one row per function and the corresponding run time estimates (self: code in that function only, total: including all descendant functions):

```{r minimal-plain-rprof}
out_file <- tempfile("jointprof", fileext = ".out")
Rprof(out_file, gc.profiling = TRUE)
for (i in 1:10) test(800)
Rprof(NULL)

summary <- summaryRprof(out_file)
summary$by.self
```

This is a nice overview, but for `fun_cpp()` the run time is hidden in the entry for [`.Call()`](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/base/versions/3.4.3/topics/CallExternal): calls into native code are opaque and cannot be resolved further. Enter joint profiling:

```{r minimal-jointprof}
library(jointprof)
out_file <- tempfile("jointprof", fileext = ".out")
start_profiler(out_file)
for (i in 1:10) test(700)
stop_profiler()

summary <- summaryRprof(out_file)
summary$by.self
```

The summary now also contains a breakdown for native functions below the R code that calls them.

## Usage

The [`start_profiler()` and `stop_profiler()`](https://r-prof.github.io/jointprof/reference/start_profiler.html) functions are replacements for `Rprof()` and `Rprof(NULL)`, respectively. The generated output file is compatible with that generated by `Rprof()`. This enables a variety of ways to analyze the results, see also the subsequent section.

```{r show-out-contents}
out_file <- tempfile("jointprof", fileext = ".out")
start_profiler(out_file)
for (i in 1:10) test(700)
stop_profiler()

strtrim(readLines(out_file, n = 12), 90)
```

Furthermore `stop_profiler()` returns an in-memory representation of the profiled data, invisibly. See [`?profiler::validate_profile`](https://r-prof.github.io/profile/reference/validate_profile.html) for a description of the data format.

```{r show-profile-data}
out_file <- tempfile("jointprof", fileext = ".out")
start_profiler(out_file)
for (i in 1:10) test(700)
profile_data <- stop_profiler()

profile_data

profile_data$samples
profile_data$locations
profile_data$functions
```

The profile data can be edited, and written to a file via [`write_rprof()`](https://r-prof.github.io/profile/reference/write_rprof.html) or (in [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof)-compatible format) via [`profile::write_pprof()`](https://r-prof.github.io/profile/reference/write_pprof.html). The example below removes the first 15 entries from all samples, and writes the resulting profile data in `pprof` format:

```{r tweak-profile-data}
profile_data$samples$locations <- lapply(
  profile_data$samples$locations,
  head,
  -15
)

pprof_file <- tempfile("jointprof", fileext = ".pb.gz")
profile::write_pprof(profile_data, pprof_file)
```

We then use `pprof` to visualize the call *graph*, using [`find_pprof()`](https://r-prof.github.io/jointprof/reference/find_pprof.html) to get the path to the `pprof` executable:

```{r minimal-graph}
dir.create(knit_dir("jointprof_fig"), recursive = TRUE, showWarnings = FALSE)
svg_file <- knit_dir("jointprof_fig/minimal.svg")

system2(
  find_pprof(),
  c(
    "-svg",
    "-nodefraction 0.01",
    "-output",
    shQuote(svg_file),
    shQuote(pprof_file)
  )
)

png_file <- knit_dir("jointprof_fig/minimal.png")
rsvg::rsvg_png(svg_file, png_file, width = 680)
```

[![Call graph (click to show image)](jointprof_fig/minimal.png)](jointprof_fig/minimal.svg)

The call graph shows a unified view of run time costs for both R and native code. (Click on the image to see the SVG version.)

For interactive exploration of a call graph, try the built-in web browser view:

```r
system2(
  find_pprof(),
  c(
    "-http",
    "localhost:8080",
    shQuote(pprof_file)
  )
)
```

## Other packages for analyzing profiler data

I'm aware of the following R packages that process profiler data, ordered by date of first CRAN release:

- [*proftools*](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/proftools/index.html): Mature, the paper's includes facilities for summarizing results at the function, call,
and source line level; for filtering to narrow the focus to functions of primary interest;
and for visualizing profiling data. Also offers an export to [callgrind](http://valgrind.org/docs/manual/cl-manual.html) format.

- [*profvis*](https://rstudio.github.io/profvis/): Interactive exploration of the flame graph and call tree in a web browser.

- [*prof.tree*](https://github.com/artemklevtsov/prof.tree#proftree): Shows a call tree on the console.

I'd also like to mention two other tools outside the R ecosystem:

- [`pprof`](https://github.com/google/pprof): A new tool written in Go, supports varios output formats (including callgrind) and also interactive exploration of the flame graph and call graph in a web browser.

- [KCacheGrind](https://kcachegrind.github.io/html/Home.html): KDE-based interactive exploration, expects callgrind input.


## Caveats

A few major points have been left unresolved until a forthcoming release:

- Nested calls back into R code are not fully supported yet. In situations where native code evaluates R expressions which then invoke native code again, the recorded stack trace will look wrong.

If your R code calls into native code, or if you want to try `pprof` with R profiling results, give the *jointprof* package a try! If you discover problems or have comments, [file an issue](https://github.com/r-prof/jointprof/issues). I'd be especially grateful for help with other Linux distributions or OS X.
